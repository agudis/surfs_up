# surfs_up

## Overview 
In this challenge assignment, we are looking into how practical it is to open up a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. We used SQLite, SQLAlchemy and Flask while also using Python, Pandas and Jupyter notebook to perform year-round weather analysis. 

Before agreeing to open the surf shop, our investor would like to see temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the business would be sustainable all year.

## Results 
By running queries and retrieving all of the June and December temperatures in Oahu and viewing the summary statistics, we can see the three main differences between the two months.

- The highest temperature in June is only 2 degrees higher than the highest temperature in December. 
- The lowest temperature in June is 8 degrees higher than the lowest temperature in December. 
- The average temperatures in June and December are quite similar with June's average reaching almost 75 degrees and Decembers average being 71 degrees.

## Summary 
Overall, the data is promising that our surf shop would be sustainable year-round. The average temperature is similiar for the two months. While the lowest temperature recorded in December is only in the 50's, the average temperature is still warm enough that people would most likely still be interested in surfing and enjoying an ice cream cone. 

### Additional Queries 
Additional queries could be ran to gather more weather data for June and December. 

1. I would suggest looking at the daily precipitation amounts for both months to ensure the amounts are suitable to opening the surf shop. Too much precipitation could result in a low number of surfboard rentals and ice cream sales. 
2. I would also perform summary statistics on precipitation to see what the average is for the month.
